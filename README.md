## Development

This plugin was developed with the assistance of **Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)**, an AI-powered coding assistant by Anthropic. Claude Code was used throughout the development process for:

- **Code Architecture**: Designing the plugin structure and component organization
- **Implementation**: Writing PHP classes, controllers, and data access objects
- **OJS Integration**: Ensuring compatibility with OJS 3.3.x and 3.4.x APIs
- **Database Design**: Creating the migration system and schema
- **Testing & Debugging**: Identifying and fixing compatibility issues
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive user and technical documentation
- **Code Review**: Analyzing code quality and identifying potential improvements

The iterative development approach with Claude Code enabled rapid prototyping, thorough testing across OJS versions, and production-ready code quality.

## Features

- **Automated Certificate Generation**: Certificates are automatically available when reviewers complete their reviews
- **Customizable Templates**: Each journal can design unique certificate templates with custom backgrounds, fonts, and colors
- **Dynamic Content**: Insert reviewer names, journal names, submission titles, and dates using template variables
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Set minimum review requirements before certificates become available
- **QR Code Verification**: Include QR codes for certificate authenticity verification
- **Download Tracking**: Track certificate downloads and usage statistics
- **Multi-language Support**: Full internationalization support
- **Batch Generation**: Generate certificates for multiple reviewers at once

## Troubleshooting

### Certificates Not Appearing

- Verify the plugin is enabled
- Check that reviews are marked as completed
- Confirm minimum review requirements are met
- Check file permissions on the files directory

### PDF Generation Errors

- Ensure TCPDF library is properly installed
- Verify PHP memory limit (recommended: 256MB)
- Check PHP error logs for specific issues
- Ensure GD or Imagick extension is enabled

### Background Image Issues

- Verify image format (JPG or PNG only)
- Check image file size (keep under 5MB)
- Ensure correct file permissions
- Use recommended dimensions (2100x2970 pixels)

### Download Permission Errors

- Verify reviewer is logged in
- Check that reviewer owns the review assignment
- Ensure review is marked as completed
- Check server file permissions

## API Endpoints

The plugin provides these API endpoints:

- `GET /certificate/download/{reviewId}` - Download certificate
- `GET /certificate/verify/{certificateCode}` - Verify certificate
- `GET /certificate/preview` - Preview certificate template
- `POST /certificate/generateBatch` - Generate batch certificates

## Security Considerations

- Certificates include unique verification codes
- Access control ensures reviewers can only access their own certificates
- QR codes link to verification endpoints
- Download tracking for audit purposes
- CSRF protection on all forms
- File upload validation and sanitization

## Database Schema

The plugin creates these tables:
